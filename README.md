# course-calendar-latex
 A template for creating a course calendar in LaTeX for a Monday, Wednesday, Friday class. We assume that the first class day is a Monday. The starting date for each week is
 automatically included as well as the date for exams (that needn't be on any particular day of the week, but it must be a class day.)

 For UNK classes, the day of the final exam is also automatically generated.

 I give an example for a College Algebra class.
